### Disco
- The Tailwind dark mode seems to display only if firefox is set to dark mode. I tried with a theme that was sort of dark (spaceship) and tailwind did not use the dark mode.
- Despite the styling of the button taking up the entire width of the page, only if you click in the center of the page will it redirect you to a link.
- the loading bar and image carousels were a bootstrap function which helped open my eyes to just how many websites used bootstrap for their website's features.
### QCC
- Is there a way to toggle darkmode on and off through html buttons?
- Can we stretch the entire button so that if you click on any colored area it will redirect you to a link?
- For the loading bar, how do you actually implement the progress of how much of the website has actually loaded with the loading bar? 
- I see that the two side arrows move to the midpoint of the images every time you click it to turn to the next image. I think the images should all be the same dimension or have the arrows stay at a certain point so that the users don't have to constantly move their mouse to click the arrows. 
- I think it would be nice if there was a way to keep all three text boxes open when you click on them to show more details.
