### Disco
The Tailwind dark mode seems to display only if firefox is set to dark mode. I tried with a theme that was sort of dark (spaceship) and tailwind did not use the dark mode.
Despite the styling of the button taking up the entire width of the page, only if you click in the center of the page will it redirect you to a link.

### QCC
Is there a way to toggle darkmode on and off through html buttons?
Can we stretch the entire button so that if you click on any colored area it will redirect you to a link?
