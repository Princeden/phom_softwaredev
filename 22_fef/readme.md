### Disco
The Tailwind dark mode seems to display only if firefox is set to dark mode. I tried with a theme that was sort of dark (spaceship) and tailwind did not use the dark mode.
### QCC
Is there a way to toggle darkmode on and off through html buttons?

#### q0B (resources consulted, if any)

### q1 (At this point, which FEF do you prefer, and why? Your answer to this Q should be the only portion of your submission that differs from that of your teammate.)
